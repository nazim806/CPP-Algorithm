**Recursion**

Recursion is a method (procedure) where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem, so we break the task into smaller subtasks. The approach can be applied to many types of problems and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science. We have to define base cases in order to avoid infinite loops. We can solve problems with recursion or with iteration  so we can transform recursion into iteration and vice versa. 

**Tail recursion:** If the recursion occurs at the end of a function then it is called a tail recursion. Tail recursion is similar to a loop (for loop or a while loop). This method executes all the statements before jumping into the next recursive call.

**Head recursion:** If the recursive call occurs at the beginning of a function then it is called a head recursion. The method saves the state before jumping into the next recursive call which means that head recursion needs more memory because we have to store the states of the actual function calls.
